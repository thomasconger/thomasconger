### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom, and I'm a full stack software engineer. I've worked at high growth venture funded startups, presented original research at the Pentagon, love economic history, and am fascinated with the lessons we can draw from data. I get a lot of satisfaction from making effective tools that are a delight to use. At my last job, one feature I worked on saved customers more than 2 years of time.
